       <h1>Advantages of Dogs</h1>
        <ul>
           <h3> <li>Dogs don't need litter boxes. They can be house-trained and most can stick to a schedule. They can use the yard or do their business during walks around the neighborhood.</li>
            <li>Cats are usually sensitive to their environments and dislike change. Many dogs tend to accept change more easily, especially when their owners act like it's no big deal. </li>
            <li>Most dogs will instinctively protect their owners and their territory, unlike cats who are more likely to run and hide when faced with trouble. </li>
            <li>Training dogs is not as hard as training cats, who quickly tire of training sessions and walk away even if food-motivated.</li>
            <li>There's only so much you can play with your cats. Cats like to play around with their string toys and toy balls, but it's like if they're humouring you. Dogs on the other hand, love to play, and it's often interactive play that they want--especially with you like fetch.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, dogs(especially puppies) are cuter than cats.
             </li></h3>

          <h6><b>Disclaimer</b>: this was not supposed to be serious. Both cats and dogs are awesome and people have different opinions about them that should be respected.</h6>
